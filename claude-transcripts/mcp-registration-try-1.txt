● You have a working MCP server (my-mcp-server) that just needs to be registered
   with Claude Code. Here's what to do:

  Register your server with this command:

  claude mcp add my-mcp-server -- node "C:/Users/Raine/Desktop/school/2026 
  Spring/DIG4503 - low no code dev/week-4-exercise/my-mcp-server/index.js"

  Or, since you're already in the project directory:

  claude mcp add my-mcp-server -- node index.js

  Then verify it's registered:

  claude mcp list

  To confirm it's working, run /mcp again — you should see my-mcp-server listed
  with your three tools:
  - format_for_html
  - slugify_title
  - html_to_markdown

  Note: Using the full absolute path is more reliable since Claude Code may be 
  launched from different directories.


❯ `claude mcp add my-mcp-server -- node index.js` 

● Bash(cd "/c/Users/Raine/Desktop/school/2026 Spring/DIG4503 - low no code
      dev/week-4-exercise/my-mcp-server" && claude mcp add my-mcp-server -- node
       index.js 2>&1)
  ⎿  Added stdio MCP server my-mcp-server with command: node index.js to lo

     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● It worked. The server was registered to your local config.

  Now run /mcp to confirm it shows up, or verify with:

  claude mcp list

  Heads up: Since it was registered with node index.js (a relative path), it 
  will only work when Claude Code is launched from the my-mcp-server directory. 
  If you want it available everywhere, re-add it with the full absolute path:
  claude mcp remove my-mcp-server
  claude mcp add my-mcp-server -- node "C:/Users/Raine/Desktop/school/2026 
  Spring/DIG4503 - low no code dev/week-4-exercise/my-mcp-server/index.js"


❯ /mcp 
  ⎿  No MCP servers configured. Please run /doctor if this is unexpected.
     Otherwise, run claude mcp --help or visit
     https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp to learn more.

❯ claude mcp list 

● Bash(claude mcp list 2>&1)
  ⎿  (No output)

● Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● The server is correctly saved in your config. I can see it in .claude.json:

  "my-mcp-server": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["index.js"],
    "env": {}
  }

  The problem is that /mcp shows servers that are currently connected — it
  doesn't pick up new registrations mid-session. You need to restart Claude Code
   for it to load the new server.

  Close this terminal/session and reopen Claude Code from the my-mcp-server
  directory. After restarting, run /mcp again and you should see my-mcp-server
  listed.

  Also note: hasTrustDialogAccepted is false for this project — Claude Code may 
  prompt you to approve the MCP server on first load. Accept it when prompted.
